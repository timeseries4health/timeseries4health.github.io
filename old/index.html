							<p class="major">I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/"> College of Information and Computer Sciences </a> at UMass Amherst advised by Benjamin Marlin. I earned my Bachelors (Hons.) and Masters in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>  and was awarded the prestigious Institute Silver Medal.</p>

							 
							
							<p class="major"> My research interests can be broadly categorized into generative modeling and the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.  In particular, I am interested in exploring deep learning methods specifically latent-variable models for solving the problem of missing data/irregular sampling in time series. This work is motivated by the analysis of physiological time series data in electronic health records, which are sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate. Modeling such time series with deep learning can lead to accurate predictive models for diagnosis and other applications in healthcare.  I'm also interested in exploring and developing algorithms and methods for making deep learning safe and more robust.

							<h2>Modeling Irregularly Sampled Clinical Time Series</h2>
							<p>While the volume of electronic health records (EHR) data continues to grow, it
remains rare for hospital systems to capture dense physiological data streams,
even in the data-rich intensive care unit setting. Instead, typical EHR records
consist of sparse and irregularly observed multivariate time series, which are well
understood to present particularly challenging problems for machine learning
methods. In this paper, we present a new deep learning architecture for addressing
this problem based on the use of a semi-parametric interpolation network followed
by the application of a prediction network. The interpolation network allows for
information to be shared across multiple dimensions during the interpolation stage,
while any standard deep learning model can be used for the prediction network.
We investigate the performance of this architecture on the problems of mortality
and length of stay prediction.

							<h2>Time Series Forecasting with Uncertainty Estimates using Deep Neural Networks</h2>
							<h4>Microsoft Research Redmond, Summer 2018</h4>

							<p>Probabilistic forecasts for time series are critical in many situations where point forecasts do not provide enough information for decision making processes. Examples include demand forecasting, business planning, anomaly detection, and general risk management. At the same time, standard deep learning models have been shown to perform well for time series forecasting problems when datasets are large and relationships between regressors could be nonlinear. However, these deep learning models do not easily provide calibrated uncertainty estimates when applied out of the box. Recently, it has been suggested that by using Monte Carlo dropout (MC Dropout) at prediction time together with likelihood-based loss functions, neural networks can not only achieve good predictive performance, but can also capture uncertainties well. We show the effectiveness of likelihood-based loss functions in quantifying uncertainty estimates for time series forecasts while maintaining predictive performance across different datasets. Moreover, we build a multi-resolution ensemble of models to improve the uncertainty estimates for long horizon forecasts. Our multi-time scale ensemble approach can be applied to a wide range of neural networks, making it a versatile tool for forecasting with deep architectures. </p>

							<h2>Modeling Irregularly Sampled Physiological Signals</h2>
							<h4>Xerox Research Centre India, Summer 2015</h4>

							<p>Vitals such as heart rate, respiration rate, BP etc. which are monitored in hospitals to evaluate the physiological condition of a patient are stored in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) which is, most often, not recorded at regular intervals. We designed models based on linear dynamical systems using a temporal difference variable (TDV), that captures the dependencies between consecutive state and observation variables. TDV is additively used in one model and hierarchically in another model. We conducted prediction and imputation experiments on irregularly sampled physiological vitals obtained from the MIMIC-II database and showed that our models perform better than state-of-the-art methods thus revealing the value of the TDV in modeling irregular sampling.</p>

							<h2>Secure Communication In Physical Layer </h2>
							<h4>RWTH Aachen University Germany, Summer 2014</h4>
							<p>We addressed the problem of physical layer security in MISO communications in presence of passive eavesdroppers. Secrecy is defined based on satisfying QoS constraints both at receiver and eavesdroppers. The aim is to offer a given probability of secrecy by enforcing a minimum SNR at receiver and ensuring (probabilistically) that the SNR at each eavesdropper is appropriately upper bounded. We used beamforming and artificial noise as the transmit strategy to confuse the eavesdroppers by broadcasting noise in all the directions except towards receiver. We discovered an optimal power allocation strategy and derived the SNR values at the eavesdroppers to verify the given constraints.</p>

							<h2>Analysis of Dropout in Deep Networks</h2>
							<p>We present an analysis of dropout in deep networks with rectified linear units and the quadratic loss. The results expose surprising differences between the behavior of dropout and more traditional regularizers like weight decay. For example, on some simple data cases dropout training produces negative weights even though the output is the sum of the inputs. This provides a counterpoint to the suggestion that dropout discourages co-adaptation of weights. Moreover, dropout penalty can grow exponentially in the depth of the network while the weight-decay penalty remains essentially linear, and that dropout is insensitive to various re-scalings of the input features and network weights.</p>

							<h2>Deep Learning Approach To Generate Image Caption</h2>
							<p>Generating captions for images represent an extremely challenging task; it does not only involve detecting correctly the main objects on an image, but also how are they interacting with each other, what are they doing, and where is the scene happening. Our model is an example of an encoder-decoder neural network. It works by first "encoding" an image into a fixed-length vector representation, and then "decoding" the representation into a natural language description</p>
							<p>The image encoder is a deep convolutional neural network. This type of network is widely used for image tasks and is currently state-of-the-art for object recognition and detection. Our particular choice of network is the Inception v3 image recognition model pre-trained on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS image classification dataset. The decoder is a language model, could be long short-term memory (LSTM) network or recurrent neural network. </p>

							<h2>Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning</h2>
							<p>We present a deep learning approach for aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing and has a lot of applications in real world. The typical sentiment analysis is a process of classifying opinions expressed in a text as positive, negative or neutral. ABSA is an extension of sentiment analysis task to predict the sentiment of each aspect present in the text. We implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) where each word is represented as an embedding along with other word-specific features. This model yielded better results than the top teams in Semantic Evaluation 2015 Competition. Since Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have already shown great success in many NLP tasks, it was a great surprise to obtain such good results with CNNs.</p>

							<h2>Iterative and Feedback-based Data Cleaning for Statistical Modeling</h2>
							<p>Processing and cleaning dirty datasets has always been a major bottleneck for any data analytics process. For a general Machine Learning prediction task, correctness in data implies higher final model accuracy. Generally cleaning is done iteratively - clean some data, analyze and clean some more data based on the analysis. Unfortunately, for statistical models, iterative cleaning and re-training can lead to misleading results even for a simple model [Simpsons Paradox]. We explore an iterative data cleaning process in the context of training Machine Learning models that only enhances modeling accuracy at every step of the cleaning process by updating model parameters. We further provide a novel way of integrating a feedback-mechanism from the Cleaner module and the updated ML model for choosing subsequent dirty samples for clean-up. </p>

							<h2>Estimation of Blood Pressure from Non-invasive Data</h2>
							<p>Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important physiological parameter that can provide crucial information for health care. The widely used cuff based technology is not very convenient or comfortable as it occludes the blood flow in the arteries during the time of measurement. In past, Phonocardiogram (PCG), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals have been used to predict the BP values. We propose to estimate the blood pressure from PPG using Multi Task Gaussian Processes (MTGPs) and compare with Artificial Neural networks (ANNs). Both MTGPs and ANNs are evaluated on the clinical data obtained from MIMIC Database. The performance of the proposed method is found to be comparable or better than the existing methods of computing BP from non-invasive data.</p>

							<h2>Non-invasive Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurement by Vascular Transit Time</h2>

Though invasive methods have been known to measure BP continuously and accurately but they are extremely inconvenient to use and might cause infection. The widely used cuff-based noninvasive methods are also not very convenient to use especially for injured or obese people and infants. Thus, there has been an unmet need for a convenient noninvasive cuffless BP measurement technique. While cuffless methods to measure BP have been previously studied, most of them were limited to offline processing of captured signals and none have presented an end-to-end prototype. We present a simple and low-cost fully realized implementation that can measure Blood Pressure immediately after capturing heart activity signals from a user namely PPG (Photoplethysmogram) and PCG (Phonocardiogram). The data is transmitted through a Bluetooth module in the system and results are displayed in a user interactive android application. We compared our results with those measured using a commercial cuff-based digital blood pressure measuring device and obtained encouraging results of about 95% accuracy.</p>
